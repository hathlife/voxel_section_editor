\ul\b Version 1.38\ulnone\b0\par
Auto Normals 8.2 get more realistic normals with several bug fixes. This version also comes with improved renderer, ability to view the whole model, HVA loading fixes, HVA animation preview.\par
\par
\ul\b Version 1.37\ulnone\b0\par
Auto Normals 8.0 get more realistic normals. This version also comes with several bug fixes on coordinates, Red Alert 2 new files, import sections. It also reduces the cpu load heavly when the program is not being used. Contributions from VK (coding) and IcySon55 (icons).\par
\ul\b\par
Version 1.36\ulnone\b0\par
Auto Normals 7.0 finally allows the user to customize the way they want to normalize the voxel and also, it allows uber smoothed voxels. A critical bug with screenshots from the new 3d preview window was fixed users can export to other file formats such as bitmap, jpeg and png.\par
\ul\b\par
Version 1.35\ulnone\b0\par
1.33 improves the Smoothed Cubed Normalizer a bit. 1.34 also comes with the New AutoNormals 6.0, which was faster and better during the tests. 1.35 improves both normalizers.\par
\ul\b\par
Version 1.32\ulnone\b0\par
Smoothed Cubed Normalizer v2 has been improved again! Now the 3D Preview window is back. 1.33 improves the normalizer in few bits.\par
\ul\b\par
Version 1.31\ulnone\b0\par
Smoothed Cubed Normalizer v2 was improved!\par
\ul\b\par
Version 1.3\ulnone\b0\par
Smoothed Cubed Normalizer is the main feature of this version. All other auto-normalizers were removed. This version also runs much faster and renders your voxel much faster as well, in the 3d view. Mirror Left To Right returns and several bugs were fixed.\par
\ul\b\par
Version 1.2\ulnone\b0\par
Flood Fill Erase is back, full custom scheme support, paste with and without transparency working and cubed normalizer. The old normalizer is now called 6-faced normalizer. It's still available just in case people dislike the cubed one. It also fixes some major bugs and update the links and redesign the button a bit. Thanks for all of those who reported bugs during almost one year a half at VXLSE forums at PPM. 1.2a fix a small issue in the original 1.2 that could cause trouble with future auto-upgrade tools and also fixes a problem with renaming sections. 1.2b gives an image to Zoom/Magnify button, fixes the hint from Flood Fill Erase and fixes Show Used Colours/Normals. 1.2c fixes Cubed Normalizer making it work perfectly.\par
\par
\ul\b Version 1.1\ulnone\b0\par
Fixes some major bugs. Thx to ppl at Sleipnir's Stuff for reporting the bugs.\par
\par
\ul\b Version 1.0\ulnone\b0\par

Version 2.1 SE OpenGL\ulnone  \b0 "Stucuk Edit"\par
Dubbed the OpenGL version due to the fact the only addition was a new OpenGL 3D Preview window that replaces the old 3d View.\par
\par
\ul\b Version 2.0 SE\ulnone  \b0 "Stucuk Edit"\b\par
\b0 Special Thanks to AI and the PPM memebers. There have been alot of misc changes and fixes not on the changelog.\par

\ul\b Version 1.7.1 SE 3.1\ulnone  \b0 "Stucuk Edit"\b\par
\b0 Unreleased, Renamed to 2.0 SE after changes became bigger than a bug fix.\par
\par
\ul\b Version 1.7.1 SE 3\ulnone  \b0 "Stucuk Edit"\b\par
\b0 Lots of improvements, see below. Special Thx to the PPM memebers for all there ideas : The DVD (Scale Editing),  Awrethien (Colour Replacer Tool), Sk8erkid (Spraypaint brush,3D View now shows normals,Preset camera angles for 3d View,Flood Fill Erase, A More Adv Colour Replacer Tool), FinalMoon (Darken/Lighten Tool) and any others i have forgotten.\par
\par
\ul\b Version 1.7 SE 2.5\ulnone  \b0 "Stucuk Edit"\b\par
\b0 The magnify button works (doesn't zoom in on a point tho) 1X = 1:15 2X=1:30 4X=1:60, scroll bars added.\par
\par
\ul\b Version 1.7 SE 2\ulnone  \b0 "Stucuk Edit"\b\par
\b0 The line tool now works. Special thx to Banshee for helping with the maths for the line tool.\par
\par
\ul\b Version 1.7 SE\ulnone  \b0 "Stucuk Edit"\b\par
\b0 The 3D view's rotation code has been remade and nolonger deforms voxels when it rotates them.\par
\par
\ul\b Version 1.7\ulnone\par
\b0 We had input from Stucuk on how to create a depth buffer, and together with Plasmadroid and Koen we now have a fully working 3D view (where you can rotate all the way around). To prevent confusion, this is version 1.7, since we had lots of 1.6 beta's.\par
\par
\ul\b Version 1.6\ulnone\par
\b0 Will revisits the code and does a bit of tweaking\par
\par
\ul\b Version 1.4\ulnone\par
\b0 The first voxel editor for Tiberian Sun (and RA2) was created by Will. Because he lost the sources, he was unable to finish it. A few months later, he started working on Voxel Section Editor II, which was open-source (so he'd never lose the source again). After Will lost interest in the Voxel Editor, it was first continued by Plasmadroid. I(Koen) took Plasmadroid's version and improved it. So here is the Voxel Section Editor II (Will->Plasmadroid->Koen version). Since we like to keep things complex, Plasmadroid is also still working on this version.\par

\b 1.38\b0\par
 - revisions by Banshee \par
\b   - Added\b0 : View "Whole Model" on the 3D Preview Window. You can now preview all sections together, like OS: Voxel Viewer does.\par
\b   - Added\b0 : Play, pause and stop HVA animations and view other frames than the first one, as long as there is a .hva file available for your voxel with multiples frames.\par
\b   - Added\b0 : Treat Discontinuities at Tangent Plane auto normals. This option auto-detects the neighbor pixels from the pixel that is being analysed, improving the auto normals result.\b\par
  - Bug Fix \b0 :Renderer received several fixes and improvements.\par
\b   - Bug Fix\b0 :\b  \b0 Tangent Plane Auto Normals received several fixes, making it much more efficient and reliable.\par
\b   - Updated\b0 : Community links.\par
\par
\b 1.37\b0\par
 - revisions by Banshee \par
\b   - Added\b0 : Tangent Plane auto normals based on the article sent to SIBGRAPI 2007. This should find the lighting of the voxels in a more realistic way.\par
\b   - Bug Fix \b0 :Import a section will no longer crash the system.\par
\b   - Bug Fix\b0 :\b  \b0 If the program is deactivated, the application will stop rendering, severely reducing the cpu load on idle moments.\par
\b   - Bug Fix \b0 :Fixed some inconsistences with the coordinate system.\par
\b   - Bug Fix\b0 : New Red Alert 2 voxels starts with normals of the type 4 (RA2) and no longer type 2 (TS).\par
  - \b Bug Fix\b0 :Contrast of 'normals' palette has been increased to the levels of VXLSE III 1.2x\par
  - \b Bug Fix\b0 :Increased stability when opening and saving palettes, voxels and HVAs. Thanks VK.\par
  - \b Bug Fix\b0 :Fixed a render problem that would ignore the shaders of remappable colours and also not update the remappable colours of the original 3d preview when changed by the user.\par
\b   - Updated\b0 : Community links, new program icon from IcySon55 and interface improved thanks to VK.\par
\b\par
1.36\b0\par
 - revisions by Banshee \par
   - \b Added\b0 : New Auto Normals 7.0 is now available. Users are able to customize the normalizing methods and the procedures done during the operation, as well as the range of normalization and smooth process. You can also use the old 6-Faced normalizer from VXLSE III 1.2c again.\par
   - \b Added\b0 : The new 3D preview window now exports screenshots as PNG, JPG and Bitmap..\par
   - \b Bug Fix\b0 : The screenshot feature from the new 3d preview window will no longer distort colours under certain sizes.\par
   - \b Bug Fix\b0 : The chances of a access violation if you close the program before the 3d preview window are no more.\par
\b\par
1.33, 1.34 and 1.35\b0\par
 - revisions by Banshee \par
   - \b Added\b0 : New Auto Normals is now available on 1.34 and 1.35. This one also uses the concept of cubed neighborhood, but the reference map is all based on influences, instead of the old way that considered blocks inside the voxel and influence as separate things.\par
   - \b Updated\b0 : The old Autonormalizer received few bug fixes and improvements.\par
\b\par
1.32\b0\par
 - revisions by Banshee \par
   - \b Added\b0 : 3D Preview window from VXLSE II 2.1 OpenGL edition is now back and it can render together with the current Preview (at half speed, in this case). It can also be resized and all features from the traditional preview were incorporated into it.\par
   - \b Added:\b0  Shortcuts from VXLSE II are back. You can move the X, Y and Z axis by pressing x, y and z. To move backwards, add shift to it. Some other random shortcuts were added.\par
   - \b Updated\b0 : Autonormalizer is now even better. Now it uses the concept of influence area to no longer miss the direction on few specific cases.\par
\par
\b 1.31\b0\par
 - revisions by Banshee \par
   - \b Updated\b0 : Autonormalizer is now even better. I doubt that there is a better way to normalize your voxels manually.\par
\b\par
1.3\b0\par
 - revisions by Banshee \par
   - \b Added\b0 : Ability to optimize your voxel/new section for land or air unit. The difference is the bounds calculation. When Land is selection, the minimum height is 0, while Air uses the old system.\par
   - \b Added\b0 : Mirror -> Mirror Right to Left finally works.\par
   - \b Updated\b0 : There is only one auto normalizer now: Smoothed Cubed AutoNormals, that brings almost perfect normals, better than the old Cubed AutoNormals. Cubed AutoNormals and 6-Faced Autonormals are gone.\par
   - \b Updated\b0 : Voxels should be rendered about 20x faster, like in OS:VV 1.6 or better. However, this requires a bit more RAM memory.\par
   - \b Updated\b0 : Program loads faster and acts faster. The code was also improved to waste less memory. Custom schemes also load considerably faster.\par
   - \b Updated\b0 : Dropper is now the default tool from the program, instead of pencil. This prevents users from accidentally painting the voxels when creating new files or opening existing voxels.\par
   - \b Bug Fix\b0 : The program will now load sections with no used voxels instead of giving range check error.\par
   - \b Bug Fix\b0 : Failed to set data for 'Path' message won't appear anymore if you do not have administrative powers on your operational system.\par
   - \b Bug Fix\b0 : When creating new voxels or on the resize operation, the x, y and z you determine will be the x, y and z from your voxel. The order is no longer messed up.\par
   - \b Bug Fix\b0 : Normals are now copied correctly when copy is used with Spectrum -> Normals.\par
\par
\par
 \b 1.2\b0\par
  - revisions by Banshee\par
    - \b Added:\b0  Cubed Normalizer: provide almost perfect normals! (Also, updated few wrong spelling bits from the old normalizer)\par
    - \b Added:\b0  Flood Fill Erase Tool. This tool used to exist on VXLSE II and now it's back. It allows users to erase faster neighboor pixels with the same colour.\par
    - \b Added:\b0  Full compatibility with all custom schemes types and new custom schemes included.\par
    - \b Updated\b0 : Tool Buttons re-organized.\par
    - \b Updated:\b0  Loading screen/About Box re-organized.\par
    - \b Fixed:\b0  Program now loads parameters.\par
    - \b Fixed and Updated:\b0  Site links.\par
    - \b Fixed:\b0  Paste (non full) will now paste with proper transparency\par
    - \b Fixed:\b0  Resize text boxes are no longer messed up.\par
    - \b Fixed:\b0  Disable 3d view checking and unchecking works properly now on Windows XP. Windows 9x still might have the preview window not reloaded sometimes.\par
    - \b Fixed:\b0  Undo will no longer add void operations. I.e.: Hitting Flood and Fill outside the voxel will no longer compromise your undo.\par
    - \b Fixed: \b0 Whenever you apply a new section name, the Voxel Header Info window will properly update the name of the section displayed in the combo box.\par
    - \b Fixed:\b0  Show used colours/normals will now show ALL used colours, instead of hide and show the current active colours.\par
\par
\par
  \b 1.1 \b0\par
  - revisions by Stucuk:\par
    - \b BugFix:\b0  Voxels created now work in Ra2/Ts.\par
    - \b BugFix:\b0  When u asign vxl files to VXLSE III they are now opened in VXLSE III rather than just the program loading.\par
    - \b Addition: \b0 Vxl Error system implemented, if voxel has known errors when u open it, VXLSE III will inform you and ask if you want to fix the errors.\par
    - \b Addition: \b0 Maginfication from 1x to 25x has been implemented.\par
    - \b Removed: \b0 Redundent menu's removed.\par

       stopping stack overflows in very large voxel models with a lot of outside space in\par
       them\par
     - BUGFIX: normals spectrum not set when openning new models\par
     - BUGFIX: auto-normalise and optimise now clear the undo buffer (and warn the user\par
       that they will)\par
     - BUGFIX: normals spectrum now based upon the normals scheme for the section\par
     - BUGFIX: normals now shown when the normals mode is selected\par
     - CODE REVIEW: like Koen and Plasmadroid's work!  Thanks for all the effort, lads!\par
  - 1.5 skipped to allow for working versions by Koen and Plasmadroid\par
\par
  \b 1.4 final:\b0\par
  - Header editing (partially)\par
  - BUGFIX: Voxel.LoadFromFile didn't close file! Messed up things when in plug-in mode.\par

  - Little improves in: Scroll Box (Zoom in & out)\par
  - About box backgroung image changed\par
  - Rectangle tool now supported - simply click Rectangle button (left Bar) and:\par
    first click on PaintBox = Rectangle begin, second click (anywhere) = Rectangle End\par
  - RectangleFill Tool is now supported too.  [Kamil ^aka Plasmadroid^]\par
  - Floodfill: It now actually does what you'd expect: fill an entire area.\par
  - Color Select Tool added.\par
  - Brush tool added: You can choose Brush with one of 4 sizes.\par
  - Added Flip commands (Flip X, Y and Z)\par
  - Added Mirror commands (Mirror Horizontal/Vertical)\par
  - Added Nudge commands (Nudge Left/Right/Up/Down)\par
  - BUGFIX: The Undo/Redo commands didn't update the two small views.\par
  - BUGFIX: When switching direction of a view, clicks weren't translated properly (old ZBuffer bug again).\par
  - BUGFIX: Det part of the header wasn't set correctly when adding new section.\par
  - This version will be available as a TibEd plug-in along with TibEd v1.4\par
  - Loads of small changes and bugfixes, but I can't remember them all.\par
\par
  \b 1.4 beta:\b0  These changes are listed with the final version\par
\par
  \b 1.3 beta:\b0\par
  - Crosshair (showing current slice of voxel) isn't redrawn when drawing.\par
    This is a bit faster, but mostly less annoying.\par
  - BUGFIX: Rewrote the TranslateClick range checking. No more crashes, and\par
    the bottom row can now be edited properly. (also known as ZBuffer bug)\par
  - Insert sections before and after (no longer just as last section)\par
  - Got rid of all compiler warnings.\par
  - The Recently used file list now starts counting at 1 instead of 0.\par
    (only programmers make such mistakes ;)\par
  - The recently used file list now has 10 items instead of 4\par
\par
  \b 1.2 beta:\b0\par
  - New, multi-level undo/redo system (and faster than the old, single-level one)\par
  - 'New section' command added: Add new sections to voxels?\par
    (*not* tested, tell me if it works: koen@tibed.net)\par
\par
  \b 1.11 beta:\b0\par
  - New "View Header" option added\par
