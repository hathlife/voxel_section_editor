1.38 has been released on 19/08/2008. We'll start 1.39 development soon.

1.39 plans:
-> recode the way the program renders, making it more object oriented.
-> Introduce HVA functions to the program.

1.38 Alpha - 09/10/2007 - Status: Stable.
  - revisions by Banshee
    - Update: Rendering speed improved.
    - Bug Fix: Whole Voxel option at the Form 3D Preview works better and the program is reading HVA files.
    - Bug Fix: Tangent Plain auto normals 8.1 will find less wrong (inversed) normals due to a fix in the final process.
    - New Feature: Treat Discontinuities at Tangent Plane auto normals. This option changes the neighbor voxels from the voxel that is being analysed, improving the auto normals result.
    - Update: Tangent Plane auto normals has a lightly different and smarter way to get the best tangent plane possible, considerably improving the auto normals results.
